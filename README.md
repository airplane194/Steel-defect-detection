# Steel-defect-detection
A ConvNext-backboned MaskRCNN model finetuned for detecting steel defects. The training code is influenced and borrows some helping functions from the Torchvision tutorial https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html . 

The next steps is to do implement all the helping functions, train the model further with other online available steel defect datasets for more subjectiveness.
